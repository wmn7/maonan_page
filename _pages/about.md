I am currently a **PhD candidate** in Computer and Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China. My research interests include **reinforcement learning**, **LLM/VLM-based agents**, and **intelligent transportation systems**.

I am developing a lightweight Python library named [TransSimHub](https://github.com/Traffic-Alpha/TransSimHub). This library is designed to simulate and control transportation systems, allowing researchers to quickly apply reinforcement learning algorithms without spending excessive time on simulation setup.
